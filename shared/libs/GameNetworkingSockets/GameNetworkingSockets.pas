  /// A more complicated race condition can arise if both peers initiate a connection
  /// at roughly the same time.  In this situation, each peer will receive an incoming

  ///
  /// In general, symmetric mode should be all-or-nothing: do not mix symmetric
  /// connections with a non-symmetric connection that it might possible "match"

  /// use it on all connections, and the corresponding listen socket, if any.  The

  /// - When using custom signaling, before accepting an incoming connection.

  /// Setting the flag on listen socket and accepted connections will enable the
